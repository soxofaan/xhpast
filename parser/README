BUILDING

Normally, you can build 'xhpast' by running "make", which will create a binary
in this directory:

  parser/ $ make

You can run "make install" to copy that binary to the right place.

If you are developing 'xhpast', you need to "make parser scanner xhpast"
instead to regenerate the parser and scanner:

  parser/ $ make parser scanner xhpast

We ship the generated parser and scanner and do not rebuild them by default to
prevent users from needing to install flex and bison and fiddle around with
flex versions.
